        <p>
            The MEAN and MERN stacks are popular web development frameworks that consist of different technologies. Here's a crisp summary of the roadmap for each stack:MEAN Stack Roadmap:
MongoDB: Learn NoSQL database fundamentals and how to work with MongoDB.
Express.js: Understand the basics of Node.js and learn how to build web applications using Express.js framework.
Angular: Gain proficiency in Angular framework for building dynamic and responsive web interfaces.
Node.js: Deepen your knowledge of server-side JavaScript by exploring Node.js and its ecosystem.
MERN Stack Roadmap:

MongoDB: Master NoSQL database concepts and MongoDB operations.
Express.js: Learn how to use Express.js framework to create web applications.
React: Acquire proficiency in React library for building interactive user interfaces.
Node.js: Dive deeper into Node.js and understand its role as a server-side runtime environment.
Both MEAN and MERN stacks involve working with JavaScript on both the client and server sides. It's recommended to have a solid understanding of JavaScript fundamentals before diving into these stacks. Additionally, knowledge of HTML, CSS, and basic web development concepts will be beneficial for a smoother learning experience.</p>
